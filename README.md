# Chrome Dino FPGA



A full hardware recreation of the Chrome dino game, built as my final project for **Digital Logic & Computer Design** at UNC-CH.
The game runs on a MIPS CPU we coded from scratch in SystemVerilog, synthesized to a **Digilent Nexys A7 (Artix-7)** board.
The game uses keyboard input, VGA output, and simple PWM audio.

## Highlights 🚀
- **MIPS CPU** written in SystemVerilog  
- **Game logic written in MIPS assembly** (with a desktop C prototype for testing)  
- **VGA @ 640 × 480** with hardware sprite blitting 
- PS/2 **keyboard controls** (space/↑ to jump, ↓ to duck)  
- Simple **PWM audio** for jump / collision sounds

| **`asm/`**      | MIPS assembly source for the on-board CPU                                                       |
| **`hardware/`** | SystemVerilog top module, VGA controller, keyboard interface, constraint (.xdc) files           |
| **`host/`**     | Pure-C “template” version of the game that runs on a PC for logic prototyping / debugging       |
| **`mem/`**      | Memory initialization files for instruction, data, sprite  memory regions used by the CPU       |
| **`sprites/`**  | Sprite text files (dino, cactus, ground, etc) and Python helpers for sprite/audio preprocessing |
